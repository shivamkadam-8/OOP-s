        "1)What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure and organize software programs. Python, being an object-oriented language, supports this paradigm and allows you to create and manipulate objects easily. Here's a basic explanation of key OOP concepts in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Concepts of OOP:-\n",
        "\n",
        "Classes and Objects:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects (instances) will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "Object: An instance of a class. It's a specific implementation of the class with actual values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Attributes and Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "Attributes: Variables that belong to a class or an object. They represent the state or data of the object.\n",
        "Methods: Functions that belong to a class and can be called on objects. They represent the behavior or actions of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, i.e., a class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which can help prevent accidental modification of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class). This promotes code reuse and creates a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is often achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details of a class and exposing only the necessary and relevant parts. This helps in reducing complexity and increasing efficiency."

The @property decorator allows you to define a method as a property, enabling you to implement getter, setter, and deleter functionality for an attribute. This encapsulates the internal representation of data and allows for validation or computation when getting or setting an attribute."

        "Ans:-\n",
        "Polymorphism is one of the core concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and it plays a crucial role in making code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable. The term \"polymorphism\" comes from Greek words meaning \"many forms.\" In the context of OOP, it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. The key benefit is that you can write code that works with different types of objects in a uniform way.\n",

        "16)What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages that make it a popular programming paradigm. Here are some key benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called an object. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data.\n",
        "It provides a clear modular structure for programs, making it easier to understand and manage.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction allows you to hide complex implementation details and show only the essential features of an object. This simplifies code maintenance and enhances the understanding of how the system works.\n",
        "It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort by enabling the creation of reusable objects and classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows one class to inherit the attributes and methods of another class. This promotes code reuse and can lead to a hierarchical classification.\n",
        "It enables the creation of a new class based on an existing class, thereby reducing redundancy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even if they share the same name. This enables one interface to be used for a general class of actions.\n",
        "It provides flexibility and the ability to define multiple behaviors for the same method based on the object context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Modularity:\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP encourages the division of tasks into smaller, manageable, and self-contained units (objects and classes). This modular approach makes the system easier to debug, test, and maintain.\n",
        "Each module or class can be developed, tested, and debugged independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reusability:\n",
        "\n",
        "With inheritance and polymorphism, you can reuse existing code, which reduces redundancy and increases efficiency. Classes and objects can be reused across different programs.\n",
        "Well-designed classes can be used in multiple projects, reducing development time and cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "Maintainability:\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP makes it easier to manage and modify existing code. Since the design is modular, changes in one part of the system can be made with minimal impact on other parts.\n",
        "Encapsulation and abstraction lead to a clear separation of concerns, making it simpler to understand and modify code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Real-World Modeling:\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP provides a clear structure for modeling real-world entities and relationships. Objects represent real-world entities, and classes represent the blueprints for these objects.\n",
        "This alignment with real-world concepts makes the design and implementation of software more intuitive and aligned with how we perceive and interact with the real world.\n",
        "\n",
        "Concurrency:\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP can facilitate concurrent development by allowing different team members to work on different objects or classes simultaneously without causing conflicts.\n",
        "This can lead to faster development and more efficient use of resources."

        "\n",
        "Ans:-\n",
        "The __del__ method in Python is a special method, also known as a destructor, that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. Its primary purpose is to perform any necessary cleanup, such as releasing resources (like file handles or network connections) or other finalization tasks. Here's a more detailed look at its significance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Resource Management: The __del__ method is commonly used to release resources that the object may have acquired during its lifetime. This can include closing files, releasing network resources, or freeing up memory that was allocated for certain operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Object Finalization: It allows for clean-up actions right before the object is destroyed. This can be important in scenarios where you want to ensure that certain actions are taken before the object's memory is reclaimed by the garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "Automatic Garbage Collection: Python uses an automatic garbage collection system to manage memory. The __del__ method is part of this system and provides a hook into the finalization process, allowing for custom clean-up behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cyclic References: One caveat is that if objects are involved in reference cycles, their __del__ methods may not be called. This is because Pythonâ€™s garbage collector might not be able to determine the order in which objects should be destroyed. Therefore, it's generally recommended to avoid using __del__ in situations where cyclic references might occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example of how the __del__ method can be used:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "class MyClass:\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:-\n",
        "In Python, @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define methods within a class that are not bound to an instance of the class. However, they have different purposes and behaviors. Here's a detailed explanation of the differences between them:\n",
        "\n",
        "1)@staticmethod\n",
        "Definition:\n",
        "\n",
        "A @staticmethod is a method that does not operate on an instance of the class or on the class itself. It does not take the implicit self or cls parameter.\n",
        "It behaves like a regular function but belongs to the class's namespace.\n",
        "Usage:\n",
        "\n",
        "@staticmethod is used when you need a function that logically belongs to the class but does not need access to the instance (self) or class (cls) itself.\n",
        "Useful for utility functions that perform a task related to the class but do not need to modify class or instance state.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:-Polymorphism in Python, particularly in the context of inheritance, allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This is particularly useful in creating flexible and reusable code. Polymorphism is achieved in Python through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",

        "\n",
        "Key Concepts\n",

        "Dynamic Typing: Python's dynamic typing allows polymorphism to be easily implemented, as the type of an object is determined at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
